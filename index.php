                    <p>
                        I am a first-year BSc student in computer science at Queen Mary University of London, where I am immersing myself in the world of programming and technology. I have hands-on experience in Java, C#, Pascal, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, which have sharpened my coding skills and fueled my passion for creating innovative solutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a founder of a small game development group, I create Lua programs for servers and provide customer service support. I started this venture in May 2023.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to pursue a career in software development/engineering, where I can contribute to building impactful and cutting-edge applications. I am excited about the endless possibilities that technology presents and eager to dive deep into the realms of coding and development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am looking for opportunities to gain practical experience in software development, such as internships, projects, or collaborations. I am ready to apply my skills and learn from real-world challenges. I am open to connecting with professionals, mentors, and peers who share a passion for technology and software development. If you have insights to share, opportunities to explore, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out.
